# Functional Programming in TypeScript
This section of the projects folder is for practicing TypeScript with a focus on functional programming style. There are two sections so far, both based on GitHub repositories:
 1. **type-exercises** -- based on [type-challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges)
 2. **fp-exercises** -- based on [fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/learning-resources/) and [mostly-adequate-guide](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide)

Future work: some small projects and/or refactoring object-oriented TypeScript projects.
