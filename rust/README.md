# Rust
The root folder for my Rust projects. There is a lot of stuff here. Let's start
with what is finished:

Currently, my goals are to finish some basic linear algebra and group theory
with `oxidized-algebra` (see branch `rust-matrix`) and to work through the
'Crust of Rust' series, read the Rustonomicon, and possibly work on the 'PNGme'
project. That is to say that `rust-server`, `tcp`, `fun_with_trees`, and
`too_many_linked_lists` are on hold

## Finished
 - `trpl`: work from 'The Rust Programming Language' book
 - `rustlings`: all of the Rustling exercises (see README in the folder)
 - `the-dangerous-way`: followed along with 'Learning Rust the Dangerous Way'

## Partially Finished
 - `too_many_linked_lists`: just a couple things from the last chapter left

## Work-in-Progress
 - `servers-services-apps`: follows 'Rust Servers, Services, and Apps', but
   I've added my own twist to a lot of it, more-so my own little Rust HTTP
   server at this point (might rename in the future)
 - `tcp`: follow Jon Gjengset's series on TCP
 - `fun_with_trees`: some binary tree stuff, very incomplete
