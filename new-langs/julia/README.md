# Julia stuff

Currently just learning Julia.

I will start by recreating an ABM which I wrote in Python using Agents.jl (and
then possibly creating my own ABM 'framework' to work with). Then, I want to
use 'Algorithms for Optimization' (MIT Press) to try some different
optimization approaches (which are currently implemented via a SciPy wrapper in
the Python project).
