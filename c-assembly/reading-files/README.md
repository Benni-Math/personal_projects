# Reading Files the Hard Way

Some code inspired by the series of articles on
[fasterthanli.me](fasterthanli.me)

Currently finished with the first part of the series, but need to figure out
how to do syscalls with assembly on my M1 Mac... then I can continue with this
tutorial (and hopefully continue to learn more about ARM64 assembly and how to
actually use it on this computer).

Not sure what directory to put this project in, as its a bit of an
'all-around-er' which deals with multiple languages and different approaches,
but I'm putting it in `c-assembly` for now, since it is a bit of a 'low-level'
adventure, and we will be using both C and assembly.
