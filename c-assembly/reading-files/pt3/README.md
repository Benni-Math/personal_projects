# Part Three

In this part, we write code which directly accesses the Linux file system, by
reaching straight into the partition. All written in Rust, stolen from Amos'
blog. Unfortunately, this doesn't actually run on my computer, since I am on
MacOS. I might return to this later if I ever dual-boot Linux or figure out how
to directly access the root ext4(?) partition on Mac (kind of doubt that it's
possible, given that the Apple File System is proprietary).
