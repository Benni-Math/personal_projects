# Low Level Programming

The name of this directory is a little misleading, since this is also just a
general directory for low-level programming, but since most of it is C and
assembly, I thought I would stick to naming based on programming language. This
is a very messy directory, with a lot of different projects which are
unfinished, small, or just generally a mess, but this is maybe a good snapshot
of how I learn things when I don't set myself a strict book or whatever to
follow (like I did with Rust).
