# The Go Programming Langauge

In general, this is my 'learning Go' folder.

Dedicated to work which I did while reading through 'The Go Programming Language' by Donovan and Kernighan.

This also includes work taken from different examples projects and such from
all over the place, like the gopherlings project and a bunch of Go docs stuff
(from the Golang website).
