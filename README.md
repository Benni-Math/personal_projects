# Ben's Personal Projects

This repo has a few purposes:
 1. Have notes and learning material which I used when first learning a concept
 2. Smaller projects or the start of bigger projects 
 3. Miscellaneous code which doesn't fit anywhere else

Check out my other (larger) projects at:

## Outline of contents of each directory

### c-assembly

Contains learning projects and small pieces of C and ARM64 assembly code.

### docker

Contains a couple docker-compose setups that I don't really use anymore.
Was a way for me to learn the general setup for docker, but is sort of a junk folder right now.

### go

Learning material for [Go](https://go.dev) along with a small BitTorrent client and a container project.

### new-langs

Contains tiny little bits of code from all kinds of different languages.
Currently just some [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org), [Julia](https://julialang.org), and [Pony](https://www.ponylang.io).

### rust

A large collection of smaller [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) projects, walk-throughs, and learning material.
Checkout the README.md in that folder for more details.

### web-dev

Collection of web development related stuff, such as TypeScript, React, Node, Express, and a couple other things.
More 'mature' web development can be found in my personal website [repo](https://github.com/Benni-Math/personal_website).
