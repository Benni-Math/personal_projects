# Ben's Personal Projects

This is a repo for most of my personal projects. 

Here is an outline of the folder system (in alphabetical order)

Folder for learning Docker. Contains a couple docker-compose files for different project types. Currently not really in use.

## fp-ts
Collection of work on functional programming with TypeScript (and JS). Newest folder.

## rust
Folder for learning Rust along with some small projects. Current most active folder.

## web-dev
General collection of small web-dev projects. Currently less in use.
