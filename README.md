# Ben's Personal Projects

This is a repo for most of my personal projects. 

Currently having some local machine issues...
 - Need to rebase off master once html and debug files have been handled
 - Python and pip installation issues
 - Want to start containerizing everything

Here is an outline of the folder system.

(TODO: add table of contents here)

## Rust
Folder for learning Rust (hopefully some projects in the future).

## Docker
Folder for learning Docker -- contains some Python projects.
