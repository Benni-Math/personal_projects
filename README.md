# Ben's Personal Projects

This is a repo for most of my personal projects. 

Here is an outline of the folder system (in alphabetical order)

## c-assembly
Folder with low-level programming stuff, mainly ARM64 assembly, with some C
stuff planned for the future.

## docker
Folder for learning Docker. Contains a couple docker-compose files for different project types. Currently not really in use.

## dotfiles
My collection of dotfiles (config files), so that I can quickly set up new
computers.

## fp-ts
Collection of work on functional programming with TypeScript (and JS).

## rust
Folder for learning Rust along with some small projects. Current most active folder.

## web-dev
General collection of small web-dev projects. Currently less in use.
