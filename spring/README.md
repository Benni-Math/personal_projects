# Spring - A Java Web Framework

Try running `curl https://start.spring.io` to check out
how to scaffold a basic Spring project. Also checkout `demo.zip` for a basic start 
to a microservice project, which I generated using the command

```
curl -G https://start.spring.io/starter.zip -d dependencies=web \
      -d javaVersion=11 -o demo.zip
```
